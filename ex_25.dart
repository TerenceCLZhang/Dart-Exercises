/// In this exercise, we will finish building Hangman. In the game of Hangman,
/// the player only has 6 incorrect guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms)
/// before they lose the game.
///
/// In Part 1, we loaded a random word list and picked a word from it.
///
/// In Part 2, we wrote a logic for guessing the letter and displaying that
/// information to user.
///
/// In this exercise, we have to put it all together and add logic for handling
/// guesses.
///
///
/// Copy your code from Parts 1 and 2 into a new file as a starting point. Now
/// add the following features:
///
/// Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they
/// have left.
///
/// Keep track of the letters user guessed. If the user guesses a letter they
/// had already guessed, donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.
///
///
/// Optional additions:
///
/// When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.
///
/// Rather than telling the user "You have 4 incorrect guesses left", display
/// some picture art for the Hangman. This is challenging - do the other parts
/// of the exercise first!
///
/// Your solution will be a lot cleaner if you make use of functions to help
/// you!
